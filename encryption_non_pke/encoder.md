Encoding a message

This program will encode a user-defined message using a reverse alphabetical algorithm. It will find the index value of the letter in the message and match it to the index of the reverse alphabetical list, then print that letter.

The program runs, but there is an issue with encoding special characters and punctuations. It will correctly insert spaces in between words, but it will not return any punctuations or special characters are entered. I would've debugged it if there was more time.
